# Diabetes-Prediction
<b>Introduction</b>

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic condition with significant health implications worldwide. Timely identification of individuals at risk is crucial for effective management and prevention of complications. In this project, we develop a predictive model using machine learning to determine whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on eight key features. By leveraging historical data, our goal is to provide a valuable tool for early risk assessment and intervention, contributing to improved outcomes and better health management for individuals at risk of diabetes.
